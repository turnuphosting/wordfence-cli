# Faster Scanning with Vectorscan

The malware scan currently has 2 separate scan signature engines, [`libpcre`](https://www.pcre.org/) and [Vectorscan](https://github.com/VectorCamp/vectorscan). While both of these scan engines are highly performant, Vectorscan is software designed to address the specific use-case we have with malware scanning, where we need to run a large number of regular expressions against a stream of data. 

## Benchmarks for Performance Increase using Vectorscan

Benchmarking has indicated that Vectorscan can be more than 30 times as fast as the exact same scan on the exact same hardware using PCRE.

## Configuring CLI to use Vectorscan

By default, CLI will use `libprce` for scanning. To configure CLI to use Vectorscan, you can use the following command-line argument:

    wordfence malware-scan --match-engine=vectorscan

This can also be set in the INI file:

    [MALWARE_SCAN]
    match_engine=vectorscan

## Installing Vectorscan/Hyperscan

On Debian-based distros, Vectorscan can be installed with `apt`:

    $ sudo apt install libvectorscan5

Vectorscan is a fork of Hyperscan and maintains a compatible API, so installing Hyperscan on Intel-based systems will work as well. 

    $ sudo apt install libhyperscan5

We do currently support both technologies, but this may change over time if Vectorscan's API diverges from Hyperscan's. We will officially support Vectorscan going forward.

Additional installation instructions can be found [in the Vectorscan Wiki](https://github.com/VectorCamp/vectorscan/wiki/Installation-from-package).

## Known issues

### Segfaults on Ubuntu versions 22.04 and 24.04

The Vectorscan package provided by Ubuntu versions 22.04 and 24.04 will produce segfaults when performing malware scanning against certain files on some ARM systems. We've identified that this is an issue specifically with the packaged version. Compiling Vectorscan from scratch does not produce the same segfaults. We've created a [ticket on LaunchPad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vectorscan/+bug/2064951) for this issue.

### Negligible Performance Improvement over NFS

CLI will oftentimes have to scan large filesystems of relatively small files. NFS is not setup particularly well to serve many small files. Vectorscan can scan these small files fast enough where there can be not much of discernible difference between using `libprce` and Vectorscan since the scanning processes are largely I/O bound while waiting on NFS to provide the file contents.

We've observed in our own benchmarks that there is not a significant performance increase using Vectorscan over `libpcre` for filesystems over NFS shares.
